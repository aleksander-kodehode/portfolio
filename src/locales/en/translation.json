One of my big passions is cooking and collecting handmade Japanese knifes.</1> <2>Recently I have been doing a deep dive into the world of coding, which I find extremely fun and instructive. I am mostly interested in how apps and websites work on the backend, but I find that styling and making things look good is also a lot of fun!</2>"
